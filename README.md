# boilerplate-react-without-cra

This is a React project setup where we are not using standard CRA. CRA is a great tool but for small project or a quick proptype it can be a big overhead sometime. Also learning about things how they actually work is great. 
Say in the current project we want to make some changes in webpack by this project we can easily learn about thigs. We get a quick understanding about the below things.

- How things are strutured in React?
- How React understands JSX and converts it to ES5 JS?
- What webpack is?
- ESLint for follow standard Airbnb practices.
- Testing react with react-testing-library.
